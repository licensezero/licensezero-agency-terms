    \Locks\  You may lock your project through the [Website] API, by providing an unlock date.  Until the unlock date:

    \Commission\  As commission, you will pay [Agent] [Commission] percent of the total cost of private licenses and any relicense agreement that [Agent] sells on your behalf, calculated before payment processing fees.  [Agent] will take its commission by instructing the payment processor to deposit commission in its own account, directly, on making each sale.  Other than payment processing fees, [Agent] will cover its own expenses of offering private licenses and any relicense agreement.

    \Warranties\  You promise that you are legally entitled to grant private licenses and enter any relicense agreement that you offer through the [Website] API, and will be as long as the agency relationship continues.

    \Metadata\  You agree to maintain metadata in your project's manifest file as generated by the command-line interface provided by [Agent].

    \Not Exclusive\  You may license and relicense your project on your own, without [Agent], and appoint other agents to do so.  You will not owe [Agent] commission on licensing or relicensing on your own or through other agents.

    \Promotion\  [Agent] may advertise and otherwise promote your project and the sale of private licenses and any relicense agreement, but these terms do not obligate [Agent] to do so.

    \Communication\  [Agent] may send you e-mail about changes to terms and policies, and about other developments relevant to the agency relationship and [Website] more generally.
